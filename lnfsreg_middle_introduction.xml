    With the acceptance of security labels in several mainstream
    operating systems the need to communicate labels between these
    systems becomes more important. In a typical client and server
    scenario, the client request to the server acts as a subject
    trying to access an object on the server <xref target='RFC7204' />.
    Unfortunately these systems are diverse enough that attempts
    at establishing one common label format have been unsucessful.
    The reason for this is that systems implement different Mandatory
    Access Control (MAC) models, which typically do not share any
    common ground.
  </t>

  <t>
    One solution is to define a single label format which consists
    of the union of the requirements of all MAC models/implementations.
    This is not ideal because it introduces an environment where
    many MAC models would either have blank fields for many of the
    label's components or will ignore the values that are present
    all together.  This environment introduces waste and complexity
    where it is not needed.  Additionally if a policy authority or
    identifier field is specified in the label format it would
    require a robust description that could be implemented which
    would lock policy administration into the described model.
  </t>

  <t>
    Ideally a mechanism to address this problem should allow the
    most flexibility possible in terms of policy administration
    while providing a specification that is suffient to allow for
    implementation of the label format and understanding of the
    semantics of the label.  This means that the label format
    specification  would ideally contain a syntactic description
    of the label format and a description of the semantics for each
    component in the label.  This allows protocols to specify the
    type of label and label semantics that it requires while leaving
    policy and policy administration to the individual organizations
    using the protocol in their environment.
  </t>

  <t>
    Policy administration within an organization is a difficult
    problem.  This should not be made even more difficult by having
    to request permission from external entities when crafting new
    policy or just making department specific modifications to
    existing policies.  The policy authority field would allow an
    label format specification to specify a scheme for policy
    administration without forcing it on all users of security
    labels.  However by agreeing to implement a particular label
    format specification, the protocol agrees to that policy
    administration mechanism when processing labels of that type.

    <list style='hanging'>
      <t hangText='Label Format Specification:'>
        an identifier used by the client to establish
        the syntactic format of the security label and the semantic meaning
        of its components.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Multi-Level Security (MLS):'>
        a traditional model where objects are given a sensitivity
        level (Unclassified, Secret, Top Secret, etc.) and a category set
        <xref target='RH_MLS' />.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Object:'>
        a passive resource within the system that we wish to protect.
        Objects can be entities such as files, directories, pipes,
        sockets, and many other system resources relevant to the
        protection of the system state.
      </t>

      <t hangText='Subject:'>
        an active entity, usually a process, that is requesting access
        to an object.
