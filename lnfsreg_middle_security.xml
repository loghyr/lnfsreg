<section anchor="sec:security" title="Security Considerations">
  <t>
    This document defines a mechanism to associate LFS
    identifier with a document outlining the syntax and format of
    a label.  There is no security consideration in such an
    association.  The label specification documents referenced by
    each registration entry should state security considerations
    for the label mechanism it specifies.
