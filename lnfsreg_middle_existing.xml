  <section anchor='sec:CIPSO' title="Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)">
    <t>
      The "Commercial IP Security Option (CIPSO)" label format is
      documented in <xref target='CIPSO' /> and in <xref target='FIPS-188' />.
      While the cited Internet-Draft is long expired, it is widely
      supported in deployed MLS systems that support IPv4.  IANA
      has assigned IPv4 option number 134 to CIPSO.  CIPSO is defined
      ONLY as an IPv4 option.  IANA has never assigned any IPv6
      option value to CIPSO.

  <section anchor='sec:CALIPSO' title="Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO)">
    <t>
      The "Common Architecture Label IPv6 Security Option (CALIPSO)"
      label format is specified in <xref target='RFC5570' /> and
      is defined for IPv6.  As noted in Section 10 of
      <xref target='RFC5570' />  CALIPSO is a direct derivative of
      the IPv4 "Simple IP Security Option (SIPSO)", therefore CALIPSO
      is NOT derived from CIPSO in any way.

      The Flux Advanced Security Kernel (FLASK) <xref target='FLASK99' />
      is an impelementation of an architecture to provide flexible
      support for security policies. Section 2.1 of
      <xref target='FLASK99b' />, summarizes the architecture of FLASK
      to:

      <list style="numbers">
        <t>
          describe the interactions between a subsystem which enforces
          security policy decisions and a subsystem which makes those decisions
        </t>

        <t>
          the requirements on the components within each subsystem.
