    <abstract>
      <t>
	In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have
	used very rigid policies which were implemented in particular
	protocols and platforms.  As MAC systems became more widely
	deployed, additional flexibility in mechanism and policy
	will be required.  While traditional trusted systems
	implemented Multi-Level Security (MLS) and integrity models,
	modern systems have expanded to include technologies such
	as type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and
	mechanisms which need to be accommodated, it is unlikely
	that use of a single security label format and model will
	be viable.
      </t>

      <t>
	To allow multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats to
	co-exist in a network, this document proposes a registry
	of label format specifications.  This registry would contain
	label format identifiers and would provide for the association
	of each such identifier with a corresponding extensive
	document document outlining the exact syntax and use of the
	particular label format.
