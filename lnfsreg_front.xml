    <abstract>
      <t>
        In the past Mandatory Access Control (MAC) systems have used very
        rigid policies which were hardcoded into the particular protocol and
        platform.  As MAC systems are more widely deployed additional
        flexibility in mechanism and policy is required.  Where traditional
        trusted systems implemented Multi-Level Security (MLS) and integrity
        models, modern systems have expanded to include technologies such as
        type enforcement.  Due to the wide range of policies and mechanisms
        it has proven through past efforts to be virtually impossible to
        accomodate all parties in one security label format and model.

        To accomodate multiple MAC mechanisms and label formats this document
        proposes a registry of label format specifications.  This registry
        contains several identifiers to accomodate both integer and string
        preferences and associates those identifiers with an extensive
        document outlining the exact syntax and use of the particular label
        format.
